# Project: 🌈 Image Processing with NumPy — Color Channel Frequency Distribution

In this project, the NumPy library is used to analyze the frequency distribution (histogram) of pixel intensities in a colorful image—specifically, a rainbow photo. It shows how the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels contribute to the image’s overall appearance. All computations are vectorized using NumPy, meaning no Python loops are required.

## Steps:

1. Load and display the rainbow Image
2. Extract RGB channels
3. Visualize each channel
4. Compute frequency distributions
5. Visualize the color channel distributions
6. Normalize histograms for comparison
7. Compute summary statistics

## Future Scope:

- Implement Histogram Equalization to enhance contrast.
- Compare multiple images using their color distributions.
- Build a simple color-based image classifier using histogram features.
