It groups customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score — a common task 
in marketing analytics for audience targeting and persona profiling.

## Steps:
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Scale features using StandardScaler
3. Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal K
4. Train K-Means clustering model
5. Visualize customer segments
6. Export clustered dataset
