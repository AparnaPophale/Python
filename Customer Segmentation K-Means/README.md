# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
It groups customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score — a common task 
in marketing analytics for audience targeting and persona profiling.

## Steps:
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Scale features using StandardScaler
3. Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal K
4. Train K-Means clustering model
5. Visualize customer segments
6. Export clustered dataset

## Files:
- customer_segmentation.ipynb — main notebook
- customers.csv — input dataset
- customers_segmented_output.csv — model output
- requirements.txt

## Future Scope:
- Integrate demographic, behavioral, and transactional features (e.g., website activity, purchase history) to build richer, multidimensional customer personas.
- Implement advanced clustering techniques such as DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, or hierarchical clustering to compare segmentation quality and model stability.
- Deploy the segmentation model as an API or dashboard to allow marketing teams to dynamically score new customers and tailor campaigns in real time.
