# San Francisco Public Library Patron Usage Analysis (Data Wrangling)

In this project, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis are performed on the San Francisco Public Library Patron Usage dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to clean and preprocess raw library usage data, engineer meaningful features, and analyze patron behavior patterns across age groups, patron types, and library branches.


## Steps:

1. Load the library usage dataset using Pandas
2. Inspect data structure, data types, and missing values
3. Identify and remove duplicate records
4. Handle missing values using logical assumptions
5. Convert and standardize data types and text fields
6. Perform feature engineering (Total Activity, Patron Tenure, Recent Activity)
7. Conduct exploratory data analysis using visualizations
8. Outlier Resolution
9. Export the cleaned dataset for further use

- requirements.txt
  

## Future Scope:

- This project can be extended by applying predictive modeling to identify high-engagement patrons.
- Advanced analysis such as clustering patrons by behavior or building interactive dashboards can provide deeper operational insights for library planning and resource allocation.
